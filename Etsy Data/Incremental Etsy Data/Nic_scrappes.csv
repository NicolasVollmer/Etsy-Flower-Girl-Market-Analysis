I've looked extensively for an unique birthday dress for my 1 year old daughter and finally came across flower girl tutu dress with embellished petals. Not only were the designs good but the prices were affordable. 

I had a few changes that required in place.Inspite of her being on holiday, she responded promptly to all my queries and provided the apt suggestions.

Finally agreed on a design but it left little time for her to prepare and delivery. Inspite of that, she was very understanding and delivered the dress on time.

It truly was a beautiful dress that I wanted my little girl to wear. I am still so pleased with it and will be for years to come.

Thank you once again Angela. You have been extremely helpful and thoroughly professional.",A very gorgeous dress! My daughter loved it. Angela was super at communication and did all she could to ensure the dress arrived in time.

I selected express shipping and contacted Rachel since I was exactly a month away from my event and the shipping estimate said it would be a minimum of 45-60 days.  I received the dress with plenty of time to spare.

Huge thanks to Rachel and her team!",Ms Rachel was a pleasure to work with! Her work is amazing and the dresses are just as beautiful in person! I ordered 2 dresses for my daughter's wedding. She has 2 flower girls and they are both different in size.  Rachel met our special needs as the girls were between the typical sizes so she went off of their measurements instead. She was very prompt when ordering and quick to reply when messaging about the measurements. I would definitely order from her again! Shipping was pretty costly but that's out of her control. They still arrived in good time and were packaged well too.,Even more beautiful in person! The sewing quality and design are excellent. The length of the skirt was off on the dress. It was the length of the 5T instead of 6T but should work fine. I ordered 2 dresses and all of the other measurements were right. Arrived way earlier than expected too! I would definitely purchase again.,I don’t have enough space to sing the praises! I got in a bind due to a family illness & my mother in law not being able to make the flower girl dresses. I found them on this shop & was so excited but was terrible worried about getting them in time since it was so short notice. I messaged the owner and she assured me I could get them in plenty of time. She was so kind & helpful with getting the correct sizing. I received them 3 days earlier than expected! They are beautiful & fit perfect! The quality is 10/10. I cried when they put them on the girls! I will insert a picture from the wedding! Thank you again Ms Rachel! You made this situation so calm & helped my anxiety! Wedding is next Saturday!,67.81,27.44

Keeping little girls looking like little girls is a challenge these days. This beautiful dress needed a little bit of steam and spray starch for a family event. It arrived quickly, was priced fair and I was very pleased!! Thank you!!","I got 3 of these dresses for our 3 toddler/preschool  flower girls! Stunning! Just like pictures (and I have had some real duds come from Amazon)! I think they run a little bit big, but the buttons in the back can easily be moved to make a quick adjustment. They are more than long enough! If you have a tall skinny girl, move the buttons. If you have an average to slightly plump girl, they will fit fine without any adjustments. I was expecting to do more altering, but it is so easy that anyone who has a button and thread and has sewn on a button can do it.  Our youngest is a tiny 2-year-old and I will probably cut off or move the bottom ruffle. I wish it came in an 18-month, but I'll make the 2 work.
Also got burgundy and gold headbands for their hair and for the fronts of the dresses. Swoon! Pictures after December wedding!",This dress is perfect. I was skeptical about it because other dresses of this detail are usually over $100 but it’s really beautiful and the quality is excellent! The lace is not tulle but a decent weight lace and the underskirt has a light sheen (similar to satin but I think this is a polyester sateen so it’s not too shiny) that gives the lace a nice layering. Also the entire bodice is lined with a soft cotton and my little girl said it’s “comfy” and not itchy like many dressy dresses can be. Stitching and seams are very well done and every detail is flawless. I’m extremely happy with this!,1.88,13.67

Mrs Chana","I really like the item and my daughter loves it! However - a few points. The seller notes that the item will be ready to ship in 2 to 3 days. Mine arrived nearly 2 months after I ordered it! I ordered it on December 19th - mid January I finally inquired where it was - it shipped out on January 20th and proceeded to get lost in the mail as the seller did not track it. She did send out a new dress on short notice, and threw in a super cute rainbow headband - which did arrive in time for my daughters Rainbow Valentine's party. The Sparkly Star on the front arrived in Pink vs. Blue as specified in description - I did not care, just think it is odd that the sellers goes out of her way to specify blue - better to say colors will vary. I would order from the seller again but request a realistic ship date and tracking.","Very beautiful dress ! Ordered in size 6-7 years for my 6 years-old daughter, for my wedding :) Fits perfectly !

I absolutely loved this outfit for my 7yo! She is not a dress person at all and she was going to be the flower girl at my brother’s wedding so I needed something to fit her personality and have the glam for a wedding. 
It worked perfect. I went with A size large because she is in between sizes, but it was way too big because the material is very stretchy, but after some alterations it fit like a glove. I would recommend going down a size if your kiddo is in-between sizes like mine. 
I ordered the skirt as a detachable so that way she could freely party at the reception. 

I received the item beautifully wrapped with some extra goodies too and my daughter really loved it. 

Pinkerflies communicated at every step of the process and answered my multiple questions.

So thank you a million times over for making my daughter look and feel like a fairy princess while her mommy and daddy tied the knot","Okay, so I have a lot to say. The shop owner is amazing with communicating and accommodating her customers. I reached out to her like a month and a half out from my wedding (June 5), and the shipping was estimated to be extremely close to my wedding date (like the end of May) when it arrived. Well I told her the urgency and asked if it was doable and she shipped it so fast and we received it way ahead of time!! The quality is amazing, it’s absolutely perfect and exactly what I bought. It fits my flower girl perfect (because she asked for measurements). I had a hard time finding a shop in the US to buy from because of shipping, and this shop was perfect. They accommodated me and were so nice! I highly recommend this shop. Great customer service, care, shipping, you name it.",This dress is absolutely gorgeous!!  It definitely exceeded my expectations.  I purchased two for the flower girls in my daughters wedding.  The detail work on it is simply beautiful.  The measurements i sent to the shop were spot on and they arrived in a timely manner.  The girls had so many compliments on the dresses!  THANK YOU!!  I highly recommend this shop!,I needed this dress for my flower girl! And can I tell you the dress looks exactly as pictured! The seller was amazing communicated with me and ensured that it arrived before my birthday! I am beyond grateful! I Love the dress so does my flower girl! ♥️,138.14,16.88

My daughters loved them and begged me over and over again to wear their “princess” dresses since the wedding. I can’t wait to take them out in the snow and do some beautiful pictures with them on.,This dress is everything! Super smooth fabric for my kids. It runs a tad big. My daughter wears a size 12 in mostly everything but she could’ve gone with the ten but I can get it altered! It’s plain and can be used for so many different things. I ordered it for my wedding but I can also use it for Christmas pictures!,I ordered it Thursday and it arrived on Saturday morning! Beautiful dress and great quality!! Would buy again!,42.95,32.7

We ordered the ivory skirt with the navy blue sash initially. After a week or so I changed my mind and wanted to switch the sash to rose gold. The seller was so nice and helpful.

Beautifully designed of quality materials, and my little flower girl was comfortable in it all day. She’s on the smaller side (48” and ~53# at 8yo) so we ordered a size 6. It was a bit long (covered her shoes) and loose in the shoulders, but my mom was able to fold over and sew the straps right at the top where the front material meets the back, which solved both issues. I used the measurements provided and figured it might be a bit big on her, though, so I’d say it is true to size and to definitely follow the measurement chart provided. Overall, thrilled with how it turned out - and most importantly, so was the bride!","This dress was perfect! My daughter loved it!! The pin on the inside of the belt got caught on the top of the dress so snagged the material a little, but totally fixable with maybe some tape over the buckle!

In the end, we did not wear the shoes at the big moment, but this was not due to the goods, but to the fact that our daughter constantly ceded them to herself. :'D The headband was not too tight, but sat very well in position.Thank you for the beautiful dress for this beautiful occasion! :))","A beautiful dress we are looking forward to showing it to everyone at the christening.The little princess feels very comfortable.Since our daughter has very large feet, the supplied ones were unfortunately too small but it was no problem to find a solution with the supplier.Thank you very much!",Beautiful dress 😍 skill don't wait to put it on 🥰,👍👍,129.99,5.0

I did get a size 5 for my daughter for a wedding in October. She is a size 6. But, she’s tall and skinny! I’m glad I got the 5!!! There is definitely some room to grow into but even if she doesn’t by then, works great and fits good!!! 

I ONLY WRITE THIS, because if you have a tall/semi-talk skinny mini, and wears a size 6 but is just now fitting good into her size 6s (she’s 5yrs, will be 6 in July) go with the size lower! Don’t go bigger! 

Also, sorry for the pose of this photo, that’s all I could get from her lol. Also, the in the photo, I have it tied pretty good in the back to have it more “fitted” but seriously, you wouldn’t be able to tell! Very pleased! Thank you!","Loved the dress! The dress was beautiful

Needless to say, she got a lot of attention in Disney and was even told her dress was better than the real Cinderella's! Thank you so much. We hope to use you again in the future :) ","This dress has a long lead time because Angela has no competition - it seems - in the world. This dress surpasses all four year old dreams and the photograph one hundred per cent does not do it justice. I have no doubt I will get a million other photos as she is never going to take it off. I really can't emphasise enough how much she loves this dress. It is like being a four year old bride (literally, her sister was carrying the train). Thank you Angela for your thoughtful, kind and courteous service. 

Did I mention we LOVE it?",Truly the best Cinderella inspired dress ever. AngelsEmporiumTutus is truly amazing honey your work is just incredible I'm lost for words. Thank you so much for your time and work in making my daughter's dress she looked just like Cinderella exactly what I was going for made the day more perfect... once again Thank you so very much xoxo...,"I can’t begin to explain how utterly beautiful this dress is, I messaged the seller a week before the event my daughter was going to and asked if there was any chance she could squeeze us in, she did!
